# hogSkulls
Hello. Skulls here.

    This is the repository that we put our animatronic skull programs in. To use the JavaScript files, you need to have node.js installed onto your computer. Just about all of the files in the repo use johnny-five and keypress modules. These programs are intended for use on an arduino that is connected to three animatronic skulls.
